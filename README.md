# Arduino Solar Tracker for Enhancing the Efficiency of Photovoltaic Cells
This project is an Arduino-based solar tracker that continuously adjusts the position of a solar panel to maximize exposure to sunlight. By using light sensors (LDRs), the system tracks the sun's movement and positions the solar panel for optimal energy capture throughout the day.

## Features
- **Automatic Sun Tracking**: Uses LDR sensors to detect the sun's position and adjust the solar panel accordingly.
- **Dual-axis tracking**: Tracks both horizontal and vertical angles to capture the maximum sunlight.
- **Real-time adjustments**: Continuously updates panel orientation based on changes in sunlight direction.

## How It Works
The solar tracker works by reading the values from four LDRs positioned in different directions. These sensors detect the intensity of sunlight. Based on the light readings, the Arduino adjusts the position of the servo motors to point the solar panel in the direction where the light intensity is highest.

The system is designed to make fine adjustments as the sun moves throughout the day, ensuring that the solar panel stays aligned with the sun for the most efficient energy collection.
